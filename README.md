## About
This project is about predicting Bitcoin values using historical data from January 2016 to October 2022. We utilised several machine learning model such as Linear Regression Model, Random Forest Classifier as well as the Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) Model to try and predict the values of the Bitcoin currency. Then, we compare these models using benchmarks such as the Explained Variance Score and determine which is the most accurate in predicting its value.

## Problem Definition

- Predicting the prices of Bitcoin using historical data and
- The machine learning model that is the most suitable to predict the prices

## Models Used
- Linear Regression Model
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) Model

## Conclusion
- The LSTM Model may be the best amongst the three models in predicting the value with the highest explained variance score
- Linear regression model might be unsuitable as bitcoin prices may not increase linearly with time due to the rise and fall of its values
- The volatile nature of the prices of Bitcoin might make it hard to predict its values accurately, since it is easily affected by current affairs and the state of the world
- Regardless, prediction is still important to help stakeholders and individuals to make informed decisions and avoid loss.

## What we have learned
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks Model
- Concepts of epochs, batch normalisation, and dropout layers
- Tensorflow and Keras
- Concepts of predictors and backtests
- Utilising GitHub for collaboration
